#  Packages and Modules

Phlow has a powerful package management system that allows you to import and use third-party modules in your workflows. This makes it easier to reuse code and integrate with external libraries.

## Automatic Module Download

Phlow automatically downloads the modules specified in your flow configuration.

The official module repository is [phlow-packages](https://github.com/phlowdotdev/phlow-packages), which contains all official Phlow modules precompiled for Linux.

When you run Phlow, it will automatically fetch and install the required modules into a local `phlow-packages/` folder at the root of your project execution.

You don‚Äôt need to worry about building or installing them manually ‚Äî just describe the modules in your YAML, and Phlow takes care of the rest.

## Using modules

To use a module in your flow, you only need to declare it under the `modules` section and reference it in your `steps`.

Here‚Äôs a minimal working example that uses the official `log` module:

```phlow
main: log_example
modules:
  - module: log
    version: latest
steps:
  - module: log
    input:
      level: info
      message: "üì• Starting process..."
  - module: log
    input:
      level: debug
      message: !phs "'Current time: ' + timestamp()"
  - module: log
    input:
      level: error
      message: "‚ùå Something went wrong"
```

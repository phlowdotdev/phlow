# Phlow

## Modular Flow Runtime for Composable Backends

**Phlow** is a **high-performance, scalable, and Low Code flow runtime** built with Rust — designed to revolutionize the way you build backends. With Phlow, you can **create APIs, automations, and event-driven systems using just YAML**, composing logic like building blocks.

Thanks to its modular architecture and clear separation between control and behavior, Phlow lets you **orchestrate complex flows without coding** — and when you need extra power, simply **plug in lightweight scripts or Rust modules**.

It comes with **built-in observability powered by OpenTelemetry**, giving you full visibility into your flows, modules, and executions. Easily export traces and metrics to **Jaeger**, **Grafana Tempo**, or **AWS X-Ray**, all with simple environment variables.

If you're looking for speed, flexibility, and full insight into your backend — **Phlow is the Low-Code revolution you’ve been waiting for**.

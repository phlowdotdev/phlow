<h2 align="center">Modular Flow Runtime for Composable Backends</h2>

**Phlow** is a **high-performance**, **low-code** flow runtime built in **Rust** ‚Äî crafted to transform the way you build backends.
With Phlow, you design APIs, automations, and event-driven systems by composing YAML flows, treating logic as modular building blocks.

Its radically **modular** architecture separates control from behavior, empowering you to orchestrate complex workflows without writing traditional code.
Need more flexibility? Simply extend with lightweight scripts or Rust-based modules ‚Äî no rewrites, no complexity.

**Observability** is built-in by design. Every flow and module emits traces, logs, and metrics through **OpenTelemetry**, integrating seamlessly with Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Prometheus, or AWS X-Ray ‚Äî all via simple environment variables.

Whether you‚Äôre running locally, on the edge, or across the cloud, Phlow delivers extreme speed, effortless scalability, and full-stack visibility.
If you're ready to rethink how backends are built ‚Äî **Phlow is the low-code revolution you‚Äôve been waiting for**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Phlow is currently under active development and is not recommended for use in production environments at this time.
